Device::Blkid::E2fsprogs version 0.32
=====================================

NOTE: This extension only supports the older e2fsprogs versions of libblkid (numbered 1.xx.x)
and not the newer versions now bundled as a part of util-linux-ng (v2.15 or better). In almost
every case you would be advised to use Bastian Friedrich's util-linux-ng based Device::Blkid
module as the newer interface is reportedly backward compatible with the old one.
This module would prove useful in any situation where for any reason you are limited on your
systems to a 1.xx libblkid version which is a part of the e2fsprogs package. With respect to
version numbers, it is the convention that libblkid adopts a version number which matches the
package of which it is a part, so when the library was migrated to the util-linux-ng package
it jumped in version number from 1.41.4 to 2.15. As such, the rule of thumb here is that if
the version of libblkid on your system begins with a '1', it is an e2fsprogs-based version of
the library, whereas those which begin with a '2' are the newer util-linux-ng based builds.
Another key difference is the default location of the cache file between the two packages;
the e2fsprogs-based versions use a default cache file at /etc/blkid/blkid.tab whereas the
util-linux-ng versions of libblkid maintain their default cache file at /etc/blkid.tab.

This version has been implemented somewhat differently than Bastian's util-linux-ng build
of the library. He opted to keep much of his logic and processing in XSUB, mine is done
mostly in C; I have only used XSUB for my straight glue, everything else I kept in C. This is
not to be taken as any opinion of statement on PerlXS/XSUB, its merely a reflection of my own
background and tastes.

This package provides a Perl interface to the e2fsprogs-based versions of libblkid. It does not
support the larger and more robust API which has been added and integrated into the libblkid
library since its inclusion in the util-linux-ng package. That said, the libblkid which now
ships with util-linux-ng is reportedly backward compatible with client code dependant upon the
older, original library which would mean that this module should work with it, albeit with the
more limited selection of API calls. Please see the preceding note for additional details.

Libblkid provides a means of identifying block devices as to their content (such as filesystems)
as well as allowing for the extraction of additional information such as filesystem labels,
volume labels, serial numbers, device numbers, unique identifiers, etc. The libblkid library
maintains a mapping of all of this composite information and maintains its association with
a given block device on the system. Libblkid has become common in modern linux distributions
and can be seen in use in places such as configuration files where device paths had been
formerly used, such as fstab.

The library provides a means of probing block devices for this various meta information as well
as accessing the blkid cache file which stores this data on a local disk. Use of the cache file
can allow an unpriviledged user access to this information even though they might not have
read access to the block device.

I have endeavored to provide a more Perlish interface to the library where possible rather than
simply map the C calls to Perl ones. Most calls return an undef on failure and those which deal
with object allocations will throw a catchable exception when something goes wrong. Perl hash
types are returned as well in a number of cases.

Please read the README file in the package archive for instructions should you encounter any
problems while using this software package, as well as for instructions on building a debug
version.

E2FSPROGS-LIBBLKID VERSION HISTORY

Libblkid first appeared in version 1.33 of the e2fsprogs package back in 2003. The initial
release of the library exposed 17 function calls as part of its API. When libblkid stopped
shipping with the e2fsprogs package, the function count numbered at 25 calls which had been
the case since version 1.40 of the interface. A brief outline of the API history is as
follows:

   v1.33  -  17 calls
   v1.34  -  18 calls
   v1.36  -  21 calls
   v1.38  -  24 calls
   v1.40  -  25 calls

In version 1.36 of libblkid two functions appeared which returned version information about
the library, those were:

   int blkid_parse_version_string(const char *ver_string);
   int blkid_get_library_version(const char **ver_string, const char **date_string);

These calls have been used to provide for dynamic library version detection during the
initial configuration in the package Makefile.PL script. As these calls were not available
prior to version 1.36, dynamic configuration is not yet possible for the two earlier versions
and a default baseline target of v1.33 will be generated.
   
INSTALLATION

This module uses an optional dynamic libblkid version detection mechanism to try and ascertain
which version of libblkid is installed on the target system. It will attempt to detect the
version of the libblkid library installed on your target system and should this fail, it assumes
a pre-1.36 version and builds a default v1.33 baseline which is compatible with all versions
of the library.

To install and begin dynamic version detection:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

===== libblkid version detection =====

I have made use of a customized Devel::CheckLib module and Makefile.PL in an attempt to detect
the version of libblkid currently installed on the target system and to then generate a PerlXS
interface which directly targets and matches the API interface of that libblkid version.

This process is expected to work on all versions of libblkid later than v1.35. In the event that
the target system has a pre-1.36 version of the library, a default baseline target of v1.33 is
configured for build. Should you have any problems with this process, evident either in running
the Makefile.PL or in running make on its resulting Makefile, please see the Makefile.PL as well
as the E2fsprogs.xs file to troubleshoot. If you wish to report any problems with this version
detection, please include any output from the installation process as well as a copy of your
/usr/include/blkid/blkid.h file.
   
DEPENDENCIES

Perl 5.8.0

This module also requires these other modules and libraries:

E2fsprogs v1.33-v1.41

* Note: This package supports both dynamic version detection during the configuration phase
        of running Makefile.PL, as well as manual selection of a build target by version.
        If neither of these are suitable to your needs or there is some sort of problem with
        this on your target system, please refer to the Makefile.PL as well as Devel::CheckLib
        files; both are well documented and relatively easy to modify.

DEBUGGING and REPORTING A BUG

If you have any problems with the functioning of this library, please contact me at my CPAN
address at mroz@cpan.org. Please be sure and include a list of relevant packages installed on
your system or at least the exact version of e2fsprogs which you have installed, perhaps by
providing the blkid.h file.

Also, please build and install a DEBUG build of this module. The quickest way to generate a
DEBUG build of this package is by making a quick edit to the Makefile.PL file and uncommenting
the prefab DEFINE argument to the WriteMakefile() function call. Please refer to the details
on doing this found in the Makefile.PL file. After you have so configured your Makefile.PL,
run the initial configuration program as you would for a normal installation.

The DEBUG builds of this module generate a much higher degree of verbosity in output to STDOUT.
Please copy any output to STDOUT when you experience problems and be sure and include it in
any submission you send to me detailing your problem.

Furthermore, should you find any problems with this package and wish to submit a patch, please
send the unified diff to my CPAN address including full patch instructions as well as a
description of what issue or bug you have found and addressed. Please patch as per recommended
best practices found in the patch(1) man page, under "NOTES FOR PATCH SENDERS".

THANKS

Thanks to Bastian for all of is work on Device::Blkid, I was especially appreciative of your
POD as libblkid itself is not terribly well documented. While I did make a large number of my
own straight test calls in C against the library your documentation kept me in the right
direction and saved me a load of time. Thanks!

Thanks to David Cantrell, David Golden and Yasuhiro Matsumoto for Devel::CheckLib. I hacked it
up a little bit to manage my dynamic version checks and build, hope you don't mind.

Thanks to Tom Erskine for your insight and experience in all things Perl.

I would also like to thank Larry McInnis for the loan of some hardware on which to develop this
module. Most everything I have had been tied up and developing on the latest and greatest version
of Debian didn't make much sense.

BUGS

No known bugs at this time. That said, this module is largely written in C and does contain
a number of memory allocations. While these allocations are done inside of the libblkid itself,
I do make every attempt to free the memory explicitly when I am done with it. That said, leaks
are possible. Report any issues as is detailed above.

FUTURE

Please note that this module should be considered early release. As such, this information or its
API may change at any time. Please check CPAN for the latest version of this software.
