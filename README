Device-Blkid-E2fsprogs version 0.01
===================================

NOTE: This library only exposes the older e2fsprogs versions of libblkid ( pre-2.15 ) and
      not the newer and preferred util-linux-ng versions ( v2.15 or better ). In almost
      every case you would be advised to use Friedrich Bastion's util-linux-ng based
      L<Device::Blkid> module as the newer lib interface is backward compatible with the old
      one. This module would prove useful in any situation where for any reason you are
      limited on your systems to a pre-2.15 libblkid version which is a part of the e2fsprogs
      package. Incidentally, libblkid version numbering is based upon the version of either
      util-linux-ng or e2fsprogs of which it was a part and as such, e2fsprogs based versions
      of the library were numbered v1.xx whereas util-linux-ng versions are numbered as v2.15
      or better which was the version of util-linux-ng in which it was added to that package.
      Finally, if you are under constraints which limit your selection of which library to use,
      I urge you to grab Friedrich's package L<Device::Blkid> as it supported a newer and
      larger libblkid API.

This package provides a Perl interface to libblkid as it was a part of the e2fsprogs package. It
does not support the larger and more robust API which has been added and integrated into the
libblkid library since the library was added to the util-linux-ng package. See the preceding
note for complete details.

Libblkid provides a simple way to access and evaluate LABEL and UUID tags which can be associated
with block devices. The tags are now becoming commonplace block device and volume aliases in more
modern distributions of Linux. This Perl interface exposes the various and sundry functionality
exposed by the libblkid system library to the Perl programmer.

Recognizing that this is a Perl module, I have tried to provide a more 'Perlish' interface
where possible rather than merely map Perl subs to C functions. For example, while client code
can get a Perl object reference to the underlying C structures, they are at no time able to
manipulate structure members. This decision was made as I could not conceive of any legitimate
reasons for allowing for such access. Also, where possible and relevant, I have endeavored to
return Perl-style eval-based exceptions when exceptional conditions occur inside of the underlying
C functions. The exceptions are all string style, no objects are passed. See the L</"SYNOPSIS"> above
for further details.

DEBUGGING and REPORTING A BUG

If you have any problems with the functioning of this library, please contact me at my CPAN
address at mroz@cpan.org. Please be sure and include a list of packages installed on your system
or at least the exact version of e2fsprogs which you have installed. Also, please build and
install a DEBU build of this library as detailed below, execute the application which is using
this package and failing, and send me the verbose debugging output from the DEBUG build of this
package.

Should you wish to build a debug build of this library, please edit the Makefile.PL file and
set the __DEBUG DEFINE flag as is shown in the file. After setting, rebuild the library as per
The INSTALLATION instructions above. The debug build will produce much more verbose and chatty
output to STDOUT detailing what is talking place in the underlying C codes. Please be sure and
include all of this verbose output along with any problems you are having with this package. If
you find any problems with this package and wish to submit a patch, please send the unified diff
to my CPAN address including full patch instructions as well as a description of what issue or
bug you have found and addressed. Please patch as per recommended best practices found in the
patch(1) man page, under "NOTES FOR PATCH SENDERS".

BUGS

No known bugs at this time. That said, this module is largely written in C and does contain
a number of memory allocations. While these allocations are done inside of the libblkid itself,
I do make every attempt to free the memory explicitly when I am done with it. That said, leaks
are possible. Report any issues as is detailed above.
