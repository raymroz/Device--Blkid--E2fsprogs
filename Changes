0.01  Sat Jan  1 11:35:09 AST 2011
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-A -n Device::Blkid::E2fsprogs

0.10  Tue Jan  4 00:13:24 AST 2011
	- Moving this to version 0.10 after some feverish cleaning
        - Package builds, POD is semi-release worthy
        - Ready for upload on CPAN now as a developer release
        - still requires test script completion

0.12  Tue Jan  4 18:30:46 AST 2011
        - Cleaned up POD typos, finished documenting all functions
        - Added last two function wrappers
                - blkid_get_library_version()
                - blkid_parse_tag_string()
        - Have switched undef return types in object creation functions to
          instead throw exceptions. This happens when the cache, device and
          two iterator objects are requested from the lib.

          define used to conditionally compile a version specific target of this package
        - Modified Makefile.PL to work with changes to Devel::CheckLib to support targeted module versions
        - Re-ordered E2fsprogs.xs file. Functions now ordered in order of their appearance by version

0.26  Mon Jan 17 06:45:21 AST 2011

0.30  Sat Jan 22 18:02:49 AST 2011
        - Changed blkid_get_dev_size wrapper in E2fsprogs.xs so that it now accepts the string name representation of the
          device rather than a POSIX file descriptor to achieve a more Perlish interface
        - The get_dev_size function now returns an exception anytime there is a problem originating from a file descriptor
          allocation.
        - Updated POD details on get_dev_size call changes
        - Added block device test image file to project for unit test scripts ( t/img/ext3.fs )
