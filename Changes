0.10  Tue Jan  4 00:13:24 AST 2011
	- Moving this to version 0.10 after some feverish cleaning
        - Package builds, POD is semi-release worthy
        - Ready for upload on CPAN now as a developer release
        - still requires test script completion

0.12  Tue Jan  4 18:30:46 AST 2011
        - Cleaned up POD typos, finished documenting all functions
        - Added last two function wrappers
                - blkid_get_library_version()
                - blkid_parse_tag_string()
        - Have switched undef return types in object creation functions to
          instead throw exceptions. This happens when the cache, device and
          two iterator objects are requested from the lib.
        - Modified and reogranized README somewhat
        - Removed Data::Dump dependency from Makefile.PL
