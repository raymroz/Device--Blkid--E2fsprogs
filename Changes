0.10  Tue Jan  4 00:13:24 AST 2011
	- Moving this to version 0.10 after some feverish cleaning
        - Package builds, POD is semi-release worthy
        - Ready for upload on CPAN now as a developer release
        - still requires test script completion

        - Cleaned up POD typos, finished documenting all functions

                - blkid_get_library_version()
                - blkid_parse_tag_string()
        - Have switched undef return types in object creation functions to
